# Realistic Projectile Motion
Simulated realistic projectile motion with drag and coriolis forces in Python on various latitudes of a rotating Earth-like body. Second or fourth order Runge-Kutta methods are employed to compute the trajectory of the projectile which can be chosen in the code. Other parameters such as the mass of projectile, drag coefficient and gravitational field strength can easily be altered in the code. Additional external factors affecting projectile trajectory such as launch angle are also investigated.
